title: GMR based Heart Rate Monitor

---
This was my first academic project which got me interested in the field of Biomedical Instrumentation. For this project I worked with a fellow Electrical engineering student under guidance of [Prof. Anoop C.S.](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/anoop.cs) towards developement of a simple Heart-rate (HR) monitor. The motivation behind this project was to develope a Heart-rate monitor which doesn't require a direct skin contact. 

For this project, We worked towards developement of a real-time heart rate monitor using Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR) sensor. We validated accuracy of developed prototype in measurement of HR by testing on 26 voulnteer and published our findings in proceedings of 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society [(EMBC)](#) and can be accessed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7591819).
