This was a short project aimed at development of a non-intrusive topology for Respiration rate measurement using Giant Magneto Resistance (GMR) sensor. This project was done under guidance of [Prof. Anoop C.S.](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/anoop.cs). While experimenting with passband frequencies for Heart Rate measurement, we realised that Respiration rate information can be derived from the plethysmographic signal generated by GMR sensor.

I worked on signal processing in digital domain using Arduino-uno to give real-time estimation of Respiration Rate (RR) along with Heart Rate using Fast fourier Transform (FFT) implementation. A working prototype was developed and verified alongside waveforms observed from standard air-flow meter. We performed accuracy testing of the prototype on 20 volunteers. The results of experimentation were published in proceedings of 38th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society [(EMBC)](#) and can be accessed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7591196).
