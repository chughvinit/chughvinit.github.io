title: Digital Phase Lock loop architecture design
categories:
- blog
---

This was my 3 months Industrial training project at Texas Instruments India in summer of 2016. I worked under guidance of Mr. Raghu Ganesan on digital implimentation of Phase Lock Loop (PLL). The central idea behind the project was to architect digital implementaion of a PLL which otherwise comparises of mostly analog modules.

This project required me to develop a good understanding of a prior implementation and come-up with a better architecture to meet higher performance requirement. In a short duration I executed two different implementations of a Digital PLL and compared them on a variety of performance factors. This project helped me dovelope in-depth understanding of Matlab and Octave tools. This project also helped me to improve my coding skills and helped me develope a command over Verilog and System Verilog and VHDL digital design languages.
