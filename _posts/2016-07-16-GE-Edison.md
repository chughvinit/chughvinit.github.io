According to WHO, around the world there are more than 785 million people who are with disability. Bringing new tools to families and professional caregivers to improve the care of these patients is essential to increase the quality of life for both the disabled people and the caregivers. The central idea of this project was to design an **online and real-time Health Monitoring system** for the patients on wheelchair which can keep a continuous track of patient’s health and send an alert signal in case of any abnormal change in health.
The project was supervised by supervised by (Prof. Anoop C. S.)[https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/anoop.cs].

The central idea of this project was to design an **online and real-time Health Monitoring system** for the patients on wheelchair which can keep a continuous track of patient’s health and send an alert signal case of any abnormal change in health. In this project we developed a wheelchair embedded with **ECG and MPG sensors** for continues real-time monitoring of **Heart Rate**, **Respiration Rate** and estimation of **Blood-Pressure**. We employed the use of ESP8266 Wifi Module with integrated TCP/IP protocol to connect to server and send the data (IoT Platform), which could be accessed by the doctors/client via their mobile device through a dedicated app. This project won **Make-A-Thon award** at innovation challenge by General Electric India, [The GE Edison challenge, 2016](https://www.ge.com/in/edisonchallenge). Highlights of this project are shown below.
