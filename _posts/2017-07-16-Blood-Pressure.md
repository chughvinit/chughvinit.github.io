title: Non-invasive Blood Pressure estimation
categories:
- blog
---

This was my Batchelor's Thesis Project supervised by [Prof. Amit Patra](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/EE/faculty/ee-amit) and [Prof. Anoop C. S.](https://www.iist.ac.in/avionics/anoop.cs). The guiding principle behind this project was to model a non-invasive topology for Blood-Pressure (BP) estimation.

I worked in a team of two people towards development of scheme based on Magneto-Plethysmography (MPG) principle, able to detect Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and estimate BP in real-time. Feasibility of the developed system for BP estimation was tested on 29 volunteers and finding were published in proceedings of 39th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society [(EMBC)](#) and can be accessed [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8037170). I also wokrked towards development of an android application able to communicate with developed topology over wi-fi and bluetooth interfaces to display observed BP in real-time for the user. Below are some highlights of this project.
